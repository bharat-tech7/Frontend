    <h2>Introduction to Html</h2>
    <p>HTML <i>(Hypertext Markup Language)</i> is used to create document on the <u>World Wide Web</u>. <i>It is simply
            a collection of certain key words called "Tags" that are helpful in writing the document to be displayed
            using a browser on Internet.</i> HTML was developed by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> in 1992.</p>
